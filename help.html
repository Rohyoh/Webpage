                        Dispose of Trash Correctly and Recycle Right: This seems simple, but a gust of wind can turn an overflowing bin into a source of pollution. 
                        Always secure your trash and recycling. Crucially, take a moment to learn your local recycling rules. "Wish-cycling" (tossing non-recyclable items in the bin) 
                        can contaminate an entire batch of recycling, sending it all to the landfill where it's more likely to leak into the environment.

                        Join a Cleanup: Participate in a local beach, river, or park cleanup. This is a direct, hands-on way to stop waste in its tracks. 
                        It's also a powerful reminder of what we're up against and can be a great community-building activity. If you can't find a local event, 
                        even spending 10 minutes picking up trash during your own walk can make a real difference.

                            One of the leading advocacy groups in this space, Ocean Conservancy has been driving policy change and scientific solutions for decades. 
                            They are famously the founder of the International Coastal Cleanup, where millions of volunteers around the world collect and data-log trash from beaches. 
                            Your donation helps them not only organize these massive cleanups but also leverage the data to inform powerful policy campaigns aimed at stopping plastic pollution at its source.

                            This organization is known for its innovative and large-scale technological approaches to the problem. They develop and deploy advanced systems to remove plastic that is already 
                            polluting the oceans, most notably in rivers (to intercept trash before it reaches the ocean) and from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. A donation to them supports direct, technological 
                            intervention to clean up existing plastic pollution on a massive scale.

                            This is a grassroots organization built on the power of a network of dedicated volunteers and local chapters, primarily made up of surfers and beach lovers who see the impact of pollution firsthand. 
                            The Surfrider Foundation is incredibly effective at fighting for change on local, state, and national levels through campaigns focused on plastic reduction, clean water, and protecting coastal ecosystems. 
                            Your donation empowers local communities to win concrete victories against pollution in their own backyards.
