                    <p>Sea pollution, or marine pollution, occurs when harmful substances like chemicals, trash, oil spills, and excess nutrients enter marine environments, causing detrimental effects on marine life, ecosystems, 
                        and human health. The majority of these pollutants (approximately 80%) originate from land-based sources, such as agricultural runoff and industrial discharge, eventually reaching the ocean through rivers, 
                        storm drains, and atmospheric deposition. Common pollutants include plastics, chemicals, fertilizers, and oil, which lead to algal blooms, bioaccumulation of toxins, and habitat degradation.

                <td>
                    <p>If sea pollution isn't controlled soon, the consequences will be severe, cascading, and often irreversible. The ocean is not a separate entity; it is a fundamental life-support system for our planet.
                        The ocean's health is directly tied to our own survival. The urgency to act—by reducing plastic waste, curbing chemical runoff, transitioning to clean energy, and creating protected marine areas—has 
                        never been greater. The next few decades are critical.

                        the relationship with the ocean was very different. People saw it as this vast, unknowable expanse—a source of wonder, food, and transportation, 
                        but also as a perfect dumping ground. The prevailing attitude was, "out of sight, out of mind." Cities growing along coastlines would pipe their raw sewage straight out to sea. 
                        Factories, booming with industrial progress, saw rivers and estuaries as convenient sewers for chemical waste, heavy metals, and byproducts. The ocean seemed so immense that the idea that we could affect it was almost laughable. 
                        It was the ultimate "dilution is the solution to pollution" era.

                        Then, post-World War II, things really began to accelerate. This was the dawn of the plastic age. Materials like plastic, which were miracles of durability and convenience on land, became a nightmare in the water. 
                        But it wasn't just plastic. The chemical industry was creating a whole new suite of synthetic compounds, pesticides like DDT, and industrial chemicals like PCBs. These didn't just dirty the water; they entered the food web.
                        We started seeing eerie signs—eggshells of seabirds becoming so thin they would crush under the weight of the parent, populations of animals like otters and eagles mysteriously declining. The poison was invisible, but it was there,
                        biomagnifying as it moved up the chain from plankton to fish to predator.

                        This silent crisis led to a real awakening in the 1960s and 70s. Books like Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring," though focused on land, opened people's eyes to the interconnectedness of our ecosystem. Major environmental disasters,
                        like the massive oil spill from the SS Torrey Canyon in 1967 and later the Exxon Valdez in 1989, were horrific but undeniable. For the first time, everyone saw the images—beaches blackened, birds suffocating in sludge, the ocean itself on fire. 
                        It was no longer an invisible problem. This public outrage sparked the first real wave of environmental laws, like the Clean Water Act in the US, which began to regulate what could be dumped.

                    But as we started to get a handle on some of the obvious, point-source pollution from pipes and ships, a much more diffuse and complex problem emerged: runoff. It turns out the ocean's biggest poisoners aren't just evil corporations with a pipe; 
                    it's all of us. The fertilizers from our farms, the oil from our streets, the chemicals from our lawns—it all washes off the land, into rivers, and creates massive dead zones at river mouths where nothing can live. The problem became democratized; 
                    it was a consequence of how we all live.

                <td>
                    And then, we come to today. That plastic we fell in love with in the 1950s has come back to haunt us in a way we never imagined. We're now finding microplastics everywhere—in the deepest trenches of the Mariana Trench, in the Arctic ice, and inside our own bodies. 
                    The Great Pacific Garbage Patch became the symbol of this new era, a swirling testament to our disposable culture. The conversation has shifted from visible trash to these invisible, insidious particles, and to a new understanding that the ocean isn't just a place we visit; 
                    its health is directly tied to our climate. The CO2 we pump into the air is being absorbed, making the water more acidic, threatening the very foundation of the marine food web: coral reefs and shellfish.
